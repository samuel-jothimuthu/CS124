Html was what we used to create the U\+I for this lab. T\+He translation program however was done in C++. We implemented a binary tree which basically allows us to store elements that can reference elements lower than it. Like tree -\/$>$ branches -\/$>$ twigs -\/$>$ leaves. The idea is that only an element of lower value can be stored in bottom of another element and lower is on the left and greater on the right. So in our lab a . was considered lower and a -\/ was conidered higher. This allowed us to reference letters within the tree very quickly.
