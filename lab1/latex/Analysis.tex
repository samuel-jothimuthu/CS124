When the program begins to run the first thing it will do is tell the user what the Dictionary is and then ask the user to input a word he/she wants translated. If the user enters a word in the dictionary the program will give the traslation and then ask if the user has another word that needs to be translated. If the user enters a word that is not in the dictionary the program will ask the user if he/she want to add it in. Typing \char`\"{}y\char`\"{} (the program asks this) will then prompt the program to ask the user the translated word so that it will then be added into the dictionary and be used again when needed. Typing \char`\"{}q\char`\"{} will quit the program.
