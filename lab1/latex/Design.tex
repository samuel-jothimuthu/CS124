There are 7 parts of this lab which can be seen examined more closely later in the document. Each part has 1 specific function or purpose so as not to create confusion as to what file does what or where something is located. There will be a function to add the words back into the dictionary called addwords and there will be a selection control structure added into the main fucntion to allow the user to choose and add a new word into the dictionary. The pages that contain these functions provide more detail as to the algorithms and logic of how this is done.

The fundamental and most important design of this project is that it can and will work with another dictionary. The name of the dictionary has to be added into the program but other than that the code will work well with another file. This greatly improves portabilty and the simplicity of the code.
