Html was what ws used to create the U\+I for this lab. we were able to have buttons to select wha we wanted and customize the page very well. Html is widely used in the industry so adopting this platfrom was the propper move. The biggest advantage I see is that I am able to edit, change, and add things very easily and I do not need the user to have certain libraries installed for them to see this.
