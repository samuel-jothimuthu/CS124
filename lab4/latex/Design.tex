The Lab is designed using Fltk. This is what makes the G\+U\+I. The intention of showing the que on a seperate window was to allow the user to easily see the ques and the drivers and what actions were being taken on the pizzas Each file has a specific purpose see the individual slides to understand more. One of the design changes was the timer. There was a timer initially added into the program to show the time since launch. However since none of the queue information could be live updated (only updates when something was added or manually changed) I scrapped it since it would cause confusion. For example a pizza takes 10 seconds to cook. The pizza would do that but would not update on the G\+U\+I until the user entered something new. So it was confusing to exepect the G\+U\+I to update after 10 seconds. Now after the timer is removed the user can instead click a button which will show them the queue. The timer was largely irelevant to the program since it just counted how long it was running and not how long a pizza was cooking or being delivered. Instead a standard 10 seconds would be allotted to each pizza before the alert to have it deliver was alotted.
