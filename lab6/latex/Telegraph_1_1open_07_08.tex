Creates and opens a binary tree holding english symbols and their morse code equivalents

A table holding english symbols and their morse code equivalent is read. For each symbol, the morse code sequence is read and a node pointer points through the nodes depending on the sequence, creating nodes if they don't exist. If a '.' is read, it moves into the left child node of the root. If a '-\/' is read, it moves into the right child node of the root. This keeps going until the end of the sequence. For example, '.--' would cause the node pointer to point to the left child node of the root, then the right child node of the node it was pointing to, and then the left child node again of the node it was pointing to. If the nodes didn't exist, they would be created. At the end of the sequence, the symbol associated with it is stored in the node and the node pointer goes back to root, restarting the process until the table is finished.
