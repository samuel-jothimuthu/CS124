This is the A\+Q\+I sorting program. It uses a variety of sorting alogrithms to sort the A\+Q\+I or air quality index of multiple counties from low to high. Sorting algorithms each have different levels of efficieny so our main focus is to test and see which algorithm is the best to use for our data. We use Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, and Quick sorting algorithms. The U\+I is done on an a page formatted with html.

Features\+:

1) A user can test multiple sorting algorithms.

2) The user can check the times each alorithm took.

3) U\+I is very easy and clear to use.
