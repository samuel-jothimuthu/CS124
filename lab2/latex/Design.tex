There are 7 parts to this program. The insert and insert in order parts do exactly as they sound. Both of those fuctions insert into the list. One inserts the city is a specifc place relative to the spelling. The display and destroy functions display the list and delete the list. The build list directly function builds the list so that the list can be resued once deleted. a header file will be created to simplify function prototypes.
