A tree node to be used in creation of the binary tree. Used in conjunction with the open() function, when creating the tree, a tree node is made with '$\ast$' as a default symbol and no child nodes. The symbol is overwritten if the sequence ends at that tree node and child nodes are created if the sequence forces a node to be made there.
